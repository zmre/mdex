# mdex - console markdown viewer and explorer

Things I want to do:

1. Pretty print **markdown** in the console and interact with it, launching URLs or images
2. Fetch URLs, convert _HTML_ to markdown, then interact with the markdown
3. Work with folders of markdown folders (notes, gitbooks) and navigate around and between them
